## 👥 About the Project
This is a collaborative **Team Project** where we created a modern and minimalist portfolio website for a fictional full-stack developer. The goal was to practice advanced CSS, JavaScript animations, and a collaborative Git workflow.

## 👨‍💻 My Role & Contribution
As a key developer for the **Hero Section**, my main task was to create a memorable and engaging first impression for visitors.

*   **Developed the UI for the Hero Section** based on the design mockups.
*   **Implemented a unique gradient animation on hover**, creating a dynamic and fluid background effect that reacts to user interaction.
*   **Ensured pixel-perfect and responsive implementation** for all screen sizes.
*   **Collaborated with the team via Git** to merge the section into the final project.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **HTML5** (Semantic layout)
*   **CSS3** (Advanced animations, transitions, responsive design)
*   **JavaScript** (DOM manipulation for interactive elements)
*   **Vite** (Build tool)
*   **Git** (Team collaboration)

## ✨ Key Features of the Site
*   ✅ Minimalist and stylish design.
*   ✅ **Interactive hover effects** that enhance user experience.
*   ✅ Fully responsive layout.
*   ✅ Clean and well-structured code.
